The project was implemented according to the requirements presented in [this course](https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/Projects/Simulation/).

The project models the behavior of predators and herbivores. Herbivores move towards the grass, predators chase the herbivores.

Herbivores are depicted with a picture of a rabbit, predators with a picture of a lion.

When the program starts, the location of objects is generated randomly.
